/**
 * Noise module that outputs concentric spheres.
 *
 * <img src="modulespheres.png" alt="MODULE_SPHERE_IMAGE" />
 *
 * This noise module outputs concentric spheres centered on the origin like the
 * concentric rings of an onion.
 *
 * The first sphere has a radius of 1.0. Each subsequent sphere has a radius
 * that is 1.0 unit larger than the previous sphere.
 *
 * The output value from this noise module is determined by the distance between
 * the input value and the the nearest spherical surface. The input values that
 * are located on a spherical surface are given the output value 1.0 and the
 * input values that are equidistant from two spherical surfaces are given the
 * output value -1.0.
 *
 * An application can change the frequency of the concentric spheres. Increasing
 * the frequency reduces the distances between spheres. To specify the
 * frequency, call the SetFrequency() method.
 *
 * This noise module, modified with some low-frequency, low-power turbulence, is
 * useful for generating agate-like textures.
 *
 * This noise module does not require any source modules.
