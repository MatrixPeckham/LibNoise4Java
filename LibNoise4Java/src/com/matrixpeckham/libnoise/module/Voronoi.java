/**
 * Noise module that outputs Voronoi cells.
 *
 * <img src="modulevoronoi.png" alt="MODULE_VORONOI_IMAGE" />
 *
 * In mathematics, a <i>Voronoi cell</i> is a region containing all the points
 * that are closer to a specific <i>seed point</i> than to any other seed point.
 * These cells mesh with one another, producing polygon-like formations.
 *
 * By default, this noise module randomly places a seed point within each unit
 * cube. By modifying the <i>frequency</i> of the seed points, an application
 * can change the distance between seed points. The higher the frequency, the
 * closer together this noise module places the seed points, which reduces the
 * size of the cells. To specify the frequency of the cells, call the
 * SetFrequency() method.
 *
 * This noise module assigns each Voronoi cell with a random constant value from
 * a coherent-noise function. The <i>displacement value</i>
 * controls the range of random values to assign to each cell. The range of
 * random values is +/- the displacement value. Call the SetDisplacement()
 * method to specify the displacement value.
 *
 * To modify the random positions of the seed points, call the SetSeed() method.
 *
 * This noise module can optionally add the distance from the nearest seed to
 * the output value. To enable this feature, call the EnableDistance() method.
 * This causes the points in the Voronoi cells to increase in value the further
 * away that point is from the nearest seed point.
 *
 * Voronoi cells are often used to generate cracked-mud terrain formations or
 * crystal-like textures
 *
 * This noise module requires no source modules.
