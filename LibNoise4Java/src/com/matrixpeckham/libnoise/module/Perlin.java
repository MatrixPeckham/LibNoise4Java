/**
 * Noise module that outputs 3-dimensional Perlin noise.
 *
 * <img src="moduleperlin.png" alt="MODULE_PERLIN_IMAGE" />
 *
 * Perlin noise is the sum of several coherent-noise functions of
 * ever-increasing frequencies and ever-decreasing amplitudes.
 *
 * An important property of Perlin noise is that a small change in the input
 * value will produce a small change in the output value, while a large change
 * in the input value will produce a random change in the output value.
 *
 * This noise module outputs Perlin-noise values that usually range from -1.0 to
 * +1.0, but there are no guarantees that all output values will exist within
 * that range.
 *
 * For a better description of Perlin noise, see the links in the
 * <i>References and Acknowledgments</i> section.
 *
 * This noise module does not require any source modules.
 *
 * <b>Octaves</b>
 *
 * The number of octaves control the <i>amount of detail</i> of the Perlin
 * noise. Adding more octaves increases the detail of the Perlin noise, but with
 * the drawback of increasing the calculation time.
 *
 * An octave is one of the coherent-noise functions in a series of
 * coherent-noise functions that are added together to form Perlin noise.
 *
 * An application may specify the frequency of the first octave by calling the
 * SetFrequency() method.
 *
 * An application may specify the number of octaves that generate Perlin noise
 * by calling the SetOctaveCount() method.
 *
 * These coherent-noise functions are called octaves because each octave has, by
 * default, double the frequency of the previous octave. Musical tones have this
 * property as well; a musical C tone that is one octave higher than the
 * previous C tone has double its frequency.
 *
 * <b>Frequency</b>
 *
 * An application may specify the frequency of the first octave by calling the
 * SetFrequency() method.
 *
 * <b>Persistence</b>
 *
 * The persistence value controls the <i>roughness</i> of the Perlin noise.
 * Larger values produce rougher noise.
 *
 * The persistence value determines how quickly the amplitudes diminish for
 * successive octaves. The amplitude of the first octave is 1.0. The amplitude
 * of each subsequent octave is equal to the product of the previous octave's
 * amplitude and the persistence value. So a persistence value of 0.5 sets the
 * amplitude of the first octave to 1.0; the second, 0.5; the third, 0.25; etc.
 *
 * An application may specify the persistence value by calling the
 * SetPersistence() method.
 *
 * <b>Lacunarity</b>
 *
 * The lacunarity specifies the frequency multipler between successive octaves.
 *
 * The effect of modifying the lacunarity is subtle; you may need to play with
 * the lacunarity value to determine the effects. For best results, set the
 * lacunarity to a number between 1.5 and 3.5.
