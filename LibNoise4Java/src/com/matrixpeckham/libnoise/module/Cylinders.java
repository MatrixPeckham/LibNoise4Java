/**
 * Noise module that outputs concentric cylinders.
 *
 * <img src="modulecylinders.png" alt="MODULE_CYLINDER_IMAGE" />
 *
 * This noise module outputs concentric cylinders centered on the origin. These
 * cylinders are oriented along the @a y axis similar to the concentric rings of
 * a tree. Each cylinder extends infinitely along the @a y axis.
 *
 * The first cylinder has a radius of 1.0. Each subsequent cylinder has a radius
 * that is 1.0 unit larger than the previous cylinder.
 *
 * The output value from this noise module is determined by the distance between
 * the input value and the the nearest cylinder surface. The input values that
 * are located on a cylinder surface are given the output value 1.0 and the
 * input values that are equidistant from two cylinder surfaces are given the
 * output value -1.0.
 *
 * An application can change the frequency of the concentric cylinders.
 * Increasing the frequency reduces the distances between cylinders. To specify
 * the frequency, call the SetFrequency() method.
 *
 * This noise module, modified with some low-frequency, low-power turbulence, is
 * useful for generating wood-like textures.
 *
 * This noise module does not require any source modules.
