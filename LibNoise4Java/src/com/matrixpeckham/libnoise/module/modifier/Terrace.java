/**
 * Noise module that maps the output value from a source module onto a
 * terrace-forming curve.
 *
 * @image html moduleterrace.png
 *
 * This noise module maps the output value from the source module onto a
 * terrace-forming curve. The start of this curve has a slope of zero; its slope
 * then smoothly increases. This curve also contains
 * <i>control points</i> which resets the slope to zero at that point, producing
 * a "terracing" effect. Refer to the following illustration:
 *
 * @image html terrace.png
 *
 * To add a control point to this noise module, call the AddControlPoint()
 * method.
 *
 * An application must add a minimum of two control points to the curve. If this
 * is not done, the GetValue() method fails. The control points can have any
 * value, although no two control points can have the same value. There is no
 * limit to the number of control points that can be added to the curve.
 *
 * This noise module clamps the output value from the source module if that
 * value is less than the value of the lowest control point or greater than the
 * value of the highest control point.
 *
 * This noise module is often used to generate terrain features such as your
 * stereotypical desert canyon.
 *
 * This noise module requires one source module. Noise module that maps the
 * output value from a source module onto a terrace-forming curve.
