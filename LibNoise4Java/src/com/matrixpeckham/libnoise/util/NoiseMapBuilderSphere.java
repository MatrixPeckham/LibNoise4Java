/**
 * Builds a spherical noise map.
 *
 * This class builds a noise map by filling it with coherent-noise values
 * generated from the surface of a sphere.
 *
 * This class describes these input values using a (latitude, longitude)
 * coordinate system. After generating the coherent-noise value from the input
 * value, it then "flattens" these coordinates onto a plane so that it can write
 * the values into a two-dimensional noise map.
 *
 * The sphere model has a radius of 1.0 unit. Its center is at the origin.
 *
 * The x coordinate in the noise map represents the longitude. The y coordinate
 * in the noise map represents the latitude.
 *
 * The application must provide the southern, northern, western, and eastern
 * bounds of the noise map, in degrees.
